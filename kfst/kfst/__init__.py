# It's trying to make loading functionality from two different places transparent
# Dumbly, the Symbol class comes from the python implementation anyway (as it is mostly interesting at type checking time anyway)
# This is further complicated by:
# * needing to support import kfst; kfst.x.y along with import kfst.x; kfst.x.y and from kfst import x; x.y and from kfst.x import y; y
# * needing to support calling transducer.py as a module
# * not only have correct run-time behaviour but also correctly type
