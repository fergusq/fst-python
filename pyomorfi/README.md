# PyOmorfi

This is a pure-python implementation of Omorfi, a free and open source morphological analyzer for Finnish.

Most of the files have been copied from the [Omorfi repository](https://github.com/flammie/omorfi).
HFST has been replaced with KFST, a pure-python implementation of finite state transducers.

This package includes a pre-built transducer, so you don't need to build the transducer yourself.
For most part, this library should be a drop-in replacement for Omorfi.

## Installation

Pyomorfi is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

```sh
pip install pyomorfi
```

## Usage

PyOmorfi has the same API as Omorfi, so you can use it in the same way as Omorfi.
Please refer to the [Omorfi documentation](https://flammie.github.io/omorfi/) for more information.
Just import `pyomorfi.omorfi` instead of `omorfi`.

```py
from pyomorfi.omorfi import Omorfi

omorfi = Omorfi()
omorfi.load_analyser("omorfi.analyse.att")

analyses = omorfi.analyse("kissa")
```

There is also a function that loads the built-in transducers and returns an `Omorfi` object:

```py
from pyomorfi import load_omorfi

omorfi = load_omorfi()

analyses = omorfi.analyse("kissa")
```

## Development

This package is in very early stages of its development and there are probably many bugs.
Please report them if you find them!
