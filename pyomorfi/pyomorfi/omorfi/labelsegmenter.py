        The segments are suffixed with their morphologically relevant

        features for inflectional segments. This functionality is experimental
        due to hacky way it was patched together.

        Side-effect:
            Note that this operation stores the labelsegments in the token for
        future use, and only returns raw HFST structures. To get pythonic
        you can use Token's methods afterwards.
